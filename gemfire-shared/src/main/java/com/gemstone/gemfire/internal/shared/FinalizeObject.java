/**
 * Base class to be used by classes that need to implement some actions in
 * finalize.
 * 
 * This will eventually be used by all server/client classes that need
 * finalizers (instead of the expensive finalize methods) so is in the shared
 * location now part of GemFire.
 * <p>
 * Note that there is a significant performance impact on GC when using
 * {@link Object#finalize()} vs the approach below, so former should be removed
 * from all code and never used in product code. It also leads to significant
 * delays in GC itself leading to memory buildups.
 * <p>
 * Also note that this uses a {@link WeakReference} rather than a
 * <code>PhantomReference</code>. The reason is that PhantomReference is not
 * cleared when it is enqueued (at least in Java 7/8) so the referent remains
 * alive till it is explicitly cleared by the queue poller. This unnecessarily
 * increases the lifetime of the referent and can cause trouble if there is
 * a rapid increase of such objects. Using a {@link WeakReference} avoids this
 * where the referent will be cleared as before it is enqueued and will
 * otherwise behave similar to a <code>PhantomReference</code> assuming the
 * referent is not overriding the finalize method too.
